## Description
Workout watcher is an app that will allow a user to create custom workout routines. Users can create and name new workouts, and assign exercises to those workouts through the web interface. They can define multiple fields for the exercises to show the user how to complete each exercise, and subsequently complete each workout.

Video of the application can be seen here: --pending--

Example: --Pending--

## Installation
Users must install all required NPM packages (express, express-handlebars, mongoDB, morgan, mongoose, mongojs).  You can then run the application by opening a new terminal window, and typing “node server.js” to start the application. Then open a new browser window, and navigate to "localhost:3000" to see the application.

## Uses
Once the application is running, users can create custom workout routines by following the onscreen options. First, they must define a name for their workout. Then, they can define exercises to put inside that workout. Each new exercise they create will be added to the workout they are currently editing.

## License
This application is goverened by the MIT license.

## Tests
Users can test the application be ensuring its reachable at localhost:3000 after the database has been created, and a node server is running. Users can also test functions of the database by 1: eating or making a burger to test that objects can have attributes about them changed. 2: deleting a burger to ensure delete works. 3: creating a new burger to ensure create works.
